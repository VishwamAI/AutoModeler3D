## Introduction
Welcome to the AutoModeler3D tutorial scripts! These tutorials are designed to help you learn and master the various features of our powerful 3D modeling system. Each script provides step-by-step instructions and practical examples to guide you through common tasks and workflows.

## Model Generation Tutorial
In this tutorial, we'll walk you through the process of generating different types of 3D models using AutoModeler3D.

1. Launch AutoModeler3D and create a new project.
2. Navigate to the Model Generation menu.
3. Choose a base shape (e.g., cube, sphere, cylinder) from the primitives list.
4. Use the modification tools to sculpt and refine your model:
   - Apply the "Extrude" tool to create protrusions or indentations.
   - Use the "Smooth" tool to soften edges and surfaces.
   - Experiment with the "Subdivide" tool to add more detail to your model.
5. Save your model and export it in your preferred format.

## Animation Tutorial
Learn how to bring your 3D models to life with animations in AutoModeler3D.

1. Open an existing model or create a new one.
2. Access the Animation panel.
3. Set keyframes for your model at different points in the timeline:
   - Position the timeline cursor at frame 1.
   - Adjust your model's position, rotation, or scale.
   - Click "Set Keyframe" to save this state.
   - Move to frame 30 and make new adjustments to your model.
   - Set another keyframe.
4. Preview your animation using the playback controls.
5. Fine-tune your animation using the curve editor for smooth transitions.

## Rigging Tutorial
This tutorial will guide you through the process of rigging a character model for animation.

1. Import or create a character model.
2. Open the Rigging toolset.
3. Create a skeleton structure:
   - Start with the root bone at the pelvis.
   - Add bones for spine, limbs, and head.
   - Adjust bone positions to match your model's anatomy.
4. Set up inverse kinematics (IK) for limbs:
   - Create IK handles for arms and legs.
   - Configure IK solvers for natural movement.
5. Bind the skeleton to your model using automatic skinning.
6. Refine weight painting to improve deformations.

## Asset Management Tutorial
Efficiently manage your 3D assets with AutoModeler3D's asset management system.

1. Open the Asset Browser.
2. Create new folders to organize your assets (e.g., Models, Textures, Materials).
3. Import external assets:
   - Drag and drop files into the Asset Browser.
   - Use the "Import" function for batch imports.
4. Create and save custom materials:
   - Open the Material Editor.
   - Adjust properties like color, roughness, and metallic values.
   - Save the material to your asset library.
5. Apply assets to your models directly from the Asset Browser.

## Export and Import Tutorial
Learn how to exchange 3D data between AutoModeler3D and other software.

1. Exporting models:
   - Select your model in the scene.
   - Go to File > Export.
   - Choose a file format (e.g., FBX, OBJ, GLTF).
   - Configure export settings and save.

2. Importing models:
   - Go to File > Import.
   - Select the file you want to import.
   - Adjust import settings if necessary (e.g., scale, orientation).
   - Click "Import" to add the model to your scene.

## Rendering Tutorial
Create stunning visualizations of your 3D models using AutoModeler3D's rendering engine.

1. Set up your scene:
   - Position your model and camera.
   - Add and adjust lighting (e.g., directional, point, area lights).
2. Configure render settings:
   - Open the Render Settings panel.
   - Choose between real-time preview or high-quality render.
   - Adjust resolution, samples, and other quality settings.
3. Apply materials and textures to your model.
4. For real-time preview:
   - Enable real-time rendering in the viewport.
   - Adjust settings for performance vs. quality.
5. For high-quality renders:
   - Set up the desired camera angle.
   - Click "Render" and wait for the process to complete.
6. Save or export your rendered image.

These tutorials should help you get started with the core features of AutoModeler3D. Remember to experiment and explore the software to discover its full potential!
