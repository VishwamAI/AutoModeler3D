## AI Tools

This section provides guidance on using the AI Tools within AutoModeler3D to enhance your 3D modeling and animation workflows.

### Denoising Images
To denoise an image using the AI-driven denoising tool:
1. Load the denoising model using the `load_denoising_model` method.
2. Pass your noisy image to the `denoise_image` method to receive a denoised version of the image.

### Animating Characters
To animate a character model using AI:
1. Load the animation model using the `load_animation_model` method.
2. Provide the character model and animation parameters to the `animate_character` method to apply the AI-driven animation.

## Rendering Engine

This section covers the use of the Rendering Engine to create high-quality visualizations of your 3D models.

### Real-time Ray Tracing
To perform real-time ray tracing:
1. Set up your scene and camera.
2. Call the `ray_trace` method with the scene and camera as parameters to get a ray-traced image.

### Hybrid Rendering
For hybrid rendering, which combines real-time and pre-rendered graphics:
1. Set up your scene and camera.
2. Use the `hybrid_render` method with the scene and camera to get a hybrid-rendered image.

### GPU Acceleration
To utilize GPU acceleration for rendering:
1. Define your render function.
2. Pass the render function to the `gpu_accelerate` method to enhance performance with GPU support.
